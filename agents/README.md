# Agent instructions

Each agent's instructions live here as `agents/<name>/INSTRUCTIONS.md`
(name in lower case, spaces as dashes). They override the first version
written when the agent was created.

Agents may change their own instructions and other agents' (AGENTS-SPEC 6):
commit, merge to main, and the deployer checks the change (constitution,
tests, health) and reverts it automatically if anything fails. The
constitution itself (`docs/CONSTITUTION.md`), permissions, limits and budget
change only in commits the owner signs.
